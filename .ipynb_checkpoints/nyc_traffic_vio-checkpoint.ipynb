    "New York City (NYC) is one of the most traffic-congested cities in the world. As a result, one problem faced in NYC is motorists' parking violations. This project will explore parking violation data from NYC for the year 2022 to inform the stakeholders of the realities of the problem and provide insights to help improve the situation.     "

    ". Who were the main contributors to parking violations in NYC based on the state of vehicle registration?\n",
    ". What was the distribution of parking violations across NYC? Which areas were the violation hotspots?\n",
    ". How did the parking violations vary during the year? Which months had the most violations? \n",

The final table (parking_violations) was created and the data was then inserted into the final (parking_violation table).
