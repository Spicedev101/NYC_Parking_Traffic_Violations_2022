    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "New York City (NYC) is one of the most traffic-congested cities in the world. Consequently, NYC motorists frequently encounter parking and traffic violation issues. This project aims to explore parking and traffic violation data from NYC for the year 2022 to inform stakeholders about the extent of the problem and provide insights to help improve the situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is divided into two parts:\n",
    "1. The first part, documented in this Jupyter Notebook, involves cleaning and exploring the data using SQL.\n",
    "2. The second part involves using Tableau to visualize the data through charts and an interactive dashboard that allows users to interact with the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Tableau visualizations and dashboard can be found by [clicking this link](https://public.tableau.com/views/ParkingandTrafficViolationsinNewYorkCity2022/NYCParkingandTrafficViolationsDashboard?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).\n",

    "# Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The main objective of this project is to explore NYC traffic violation data for the year 2022 to provide answers to the following questions:\n",
    "* **Who were the main contributors to parking violations in NYC based on the state of vehicle registration?**\n",
    "* **What was the distribution of parking violations across NYC? Which areas were the violation hotspots?**\n",
    "* **How did parking violations vary throughout the year? Which months had the most violations?**\n",
    "* **How did parking violations vary based on the time of day? At what time of day are you most likely to get ticketed?**\n",
    "* **Which enforcement agency issued the most parking violations?**\n",
    "* **What was the total amount of fines issued in 2022?**\n",
    "* **What was the percentage of unpaid fines in 2022?**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis Insights:\n",
    "- **Main Contributors:** Identify states from which the most violating vehicles are registered.\n",
    "- **Geographical Distribution:** Determine hotspots and areas with the highest violation rates.\n",
    "- **Temporal Trends:** Analyze monthly and daily patterns in parking violations.\n",
    "- **Time of Day:** Assess the likelihood of receiving a ticket at different times.\n",
    "- **Enforcement Agency Performance:** Evaluate which agencies are most active in issuing violations.\n",
    "- **Financial Impact:** Calculate the total fines issued and the proportion that remains unpaid.\n",
    "\n",
    "By addressing these questions, the project aims to provide a detailed understanding of parking violations in NYC, highlighting key trends and areas for potential policy improvement.\n",

    "\n",
    "The datasets, in the form of CSV files, were downloaded from NYC OpenData and then loaded into MySQL Workbench for analysis. In this Notebook, `mysql.connector` and the `pandas` library are used to connect to the database and to visualize the outcome of some of the queries in the form of DataFrames. The data were first cleaned and prepared using SQL queries. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was then conducted to gain insights based on the questions identified earlier. \n",

    "### Key Steps in Data Preparation:\n",
    "1. **Loading Data:** Importing CSV files into MySQL Workbench.\n",
    "2. **Connecting to Database:** Using `mysql.connector` and `pandas` to establish a connection to the MySQL database.\n",
    "3. **Data Cleaning:** Executing SQL queries to clean the data, including handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing duplicates.\n",
    "4. **Data Preparation:** Preparing the data for analysis by creating necessary columns and tables.\n",
    "5. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducting an initial analysis to understand data distributions, identify trends, and uncover anomalies.\n",
    "6. **Data Visualization:** Presenting the cleaned and analyzed data through interactive charts and dashboards in Tableau Public.\n",

    "I encountered challenges while creating the table for the database. Although the data dictionary indicated that some columns were stored as numbers, I initially had to load some of the data as `VARCHAR(255)` and then convert the relevant columns to their respective data types.

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This comprehensive project utilized SQL for data cleaning, preparation, and exploration, and Tableau for visualization and dashboard creation, to analyze NYC parking and traffic violation data for the year 2022. The analysis revealed the following insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Approximately 16.3 million traffic and parking violations, amounting to $1.12 billion in fines, were issued in NYC in 2022.\n",
    "* As expected, the majority of violations (12.3 million) were for vehicles registered in NY.\n",
    "* Most violations were issued in the morning, peaking around 8:36 AM, with additional peaks at approximately 11:42 AM and 4:06 PM.\n",
    "* The most violations occurred on Fridays, while the fewest violations were issued on Sundays and Saturdays.\n",
    "* The Traffic Department was the agency that issued the most violation fines.\n",
    "* The percentage of unpaid fines was approximately 38.42% for the year 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "The findings of this project provide valuable insights for both NYC city administrators and the general public in understanding the realities of parking and traffic violations in NYC. City administrators can use the results to identify areas for improvement, such as violation hotspots and the effectiveness of issuing agencies. The general public can use the findings to better understand the dynamics of parking and traffic violations in the city.\n"
